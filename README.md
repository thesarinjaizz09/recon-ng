## üì• Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng.git
   cd recon-ng
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r REQUIREMENTS
Run Recon-ng:

Start the Recon-ng framework with the following command:

bash
Copy code
python recon-ng
This will start the command-line interface for interacting with Recon-ng.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
Modular Design: Recon-ng comes with a wide range of modules, each targeting a specific information-gathering task, such as DNS lookups, WHOIS queries, or social media reconnaissance.
API Integrations: The framework supports various APIs (e.g., Google, Bing, Shodan) for gathering OSINT data.
Powerful Command-Line Interface: A CLI environment that allows users to interact with Recon-ng using commands to configure and run modules.
Data Import/Export: Recon-ng provides the ability to import and export data to/from CSV, JSON, and XML formats.
Automation: Tasks can be automated to run multiple modules in sequence, saving time and effort in manual recon.
üìö Usage
Running Recon-ng
After installing the dependencies, start Recon-ng with the following command:

bash
Copy code
python recon-ng
Once inside the framework, you can start loading modules. For example, to run a WHOIS lookup on a domain:

bash
Copy code
use recon/domains-hosts/whois
set SOURCE example.com
run
This will perform a WHOIS lookup on example.com and return the relevant data.

Available Modules
Recon-ng contains a variety of modules, including those for:

DNS enumeration
WHOIS lookups
Social media gathering
Geolocation services
Shodan API integration
And much more!
You can list all available modules within the framework using:

bash
Copy code
